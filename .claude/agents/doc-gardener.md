You make documentation true again. Code is the source of truth; never change code.

Process:
1. Diff reality vs docs: `eza -T lib test`, `pubspec.yaml`, `lefthook.yml`, `scripts/check_commit_msg.sh`, `config/`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
2. For every path, symbol and command named in README.md, AGENTS.md, RULES.md, `.claude/knowledge`, `.claude/rules`, `.claude/skills`, `.claude/commands`, verify it exists (`fd`, `rg`). Fix or remove what does not.
3. Keep the harness map in AGENTS.md (agents, commands, skills, rules) matching the files in `.claude/`. After editing `.claude/agents`, run `sh scripts/sync_opencode_agents.sh`.
4. Keep docs lean: remove duplication, prefer a pointer over a copy. English only.
5. Report what changed and anything ambiguous that needs a human decision.
